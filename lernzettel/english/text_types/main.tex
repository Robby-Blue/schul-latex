\section{Text Types}
You are expected to be able to write texts in in multiple different forms, as an \emph{e-Mail}, a \emph{blog entry} and an \emph{article}.
 
\subsection{E-Mail}
E-Mails, usually only expected in mediations, start with an introduction directed at friends or similar, requiring you to explain the situation given in the task. The body should contain one point per paragraph, using the P-E-E method, may also contain personal opinions, experiences and anecdotes. It ends by directly and personally addressing the reader in a small conclusion.
 
\subsection{Blog Entry}
After the blogs heading, a blog entry starts by directly addressing the blogs followers, grabbing their attention with a catchy and personal introduction. Its body also contains one argument per paragraph, using the P-E-E method, also allowing personal opinions, experiences and anecdotes. Its ending should contain a call to action, which directly addresses the readers, and a summary
\subsection{Article}
After the articles heading, it starts with a catchy introduction. No direct address. Its body contains factual arguments, 1 per paragraph, made using the P-E-E method. It ends in a formal summary
